asteroids ideas:

Wrap around X-axis
	Use a system duplicate cameras overlapping to make it look seamless
Asteroids hitting upper or lower bounds disappear and respawn somewhere else in the game area.
Bullets hitting an asteroid must give off a particle effect.
When the player hit the upper or lower bounds, they warned they are about to fall out of orbit.
	A small grace-area of.. say.. 50 lengthunits out of bounds, the player will die
